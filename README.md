# Dotfiles

> Warning: If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first review the code and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk! I also recommend you take a look at Mathia's repository; it contains more macOS system modifications.
